# giph-API-page
A simple page where you can add giphs of your choosing... but really to practice API usage.

Link to deployed site: https://joeyvon2434.github.io/giph-API-page/

Purpose: This page was created to practice using APIs by utilizing the GIPHY API.

Instructions: Click the topic buttons to see some Gifs. Add new topics with 
the add topic button.

Getting Started: Load index.html

Technical Approach: Use the input filed and javascript to create an array of topics used to create buttons. Once a button
is clicked, interact with the GIPHY API, and select the necessary information needed from the returned JSON. Change links
on each giph when clicked to allow start / stop functionality. Allow user to add favorites. This page also heavily focuses
on dynamic generation of elements.
